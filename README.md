Color perception is an essential aspect of visual experiments, including those on attention, working memory, and object perception. When conducting such experiments, ensuring that the colors used in one's stimuli are equally perceivable (i.e., they stand out from the color of the stimulus's background and are equally bright) is an often-overlooked step. The R Code in this repository provides an easy way to amend this. Enter the RGB or HSL values of your stimuli, and my code will calculate the Euclidean distances (ΔE) between each of your colors (per CIE2000), as well as the Relative Luminance (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) of each color. 


In addition to the ΔE and relative luminance values between each color, the HTML data table produced at the end of this code includes a swatch of each color, the corresponding Hex code for each color, and their values in the HSL, HSV, RGB, and CMYK color spaces.
